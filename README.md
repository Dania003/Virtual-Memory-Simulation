# Virtual-Memory-Simulation
In the project, I implemented a hash table data structure to emulate virtual memory. I created a C++ implementation for a hash table data structure where keys and values were mapped to a position in a table using a hash function. For this project, I implemented hash tables in which collisions resolved using two different techniques: (i) open addressing using double hashing and (ii) separate chaining where the keys in each chain were ordered, descending, by key.

This project uses object oriented programming methods and depends a lot on the use of inheritance.
